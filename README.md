# WCIT - World Cup Information Tracker

The FIFA World Cup is a major sporting event that brings together the best football teams from around the world. To manage the information related to this prestigious tournament, we have designed and developed an efficient management platform. This platform will be tested with the Qatar 2022 World Cup, and this guide will describe the work done to create this platform.

The platform is divided into two parts: one for authorized users to enter information via **Oracle Apex** and the other for regular users who can access public information via a web platform connected to the **Oracle database**. Setting up an efficient management platform is crucial to ensuring **real-time** organization and tracking of information related to the FIFA World Cup. This can also facilitate communication and collaboration among the various parties involved in organizing the event.
